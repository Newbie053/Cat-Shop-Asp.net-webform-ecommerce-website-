         <p class="text-justify"><b>Ringworm: </b>Ringworm is a contagious skin infection caused by a fungus.It may be airborne or found in the soil. It can be transmitted to humans. Ringworm
          causes hair loss, usually in a somewhat
         circular pattern, leaving the skin dry, raised,
         and crusty. Ringworm lesions are usually
          found first on the face, ears, or paws, but
         without treatment they can cover the entire
          body</p>

         ringworm and can prescribe proper topical
        and/or systemic medication. Treatment is usually
         effective for the single cat. Catteries often have a
        chronic problem with ringworm and may require
        special measures.</p>

         <p class="text-justify"><b>Tapeworms: </b>Tapeworms are long, segmented worms that are
transmitted by the ingestion of a larval stage of the
worm found in a flea or in the raw meat of small
mammals. A cat that hunts on his own or has had
fleas will likely develop tapeworms. Individual
tapeworm segments are easily seen in freshly
passed feces or around the anus of an infected cat.
Their appearance is like a rice grain (white or beige
in color).</p>

       <p class="text-justify"><b>Preventationt of tapeworms: </b>Keeping your cat free of flea infestations with flea and tick medication is the best protection against tapeworms. However, if infestation does occur, the environment must be treated along with the cat to prevent recurring infestations.

      Since cats are fastidious groomers, you may not see the fleas that they are ingesting or know that they are contracting tapeworms until there is an infestation.

         <p class="text-justify"><b>Abscesses: </b>Cats commonly develop infections as
a consequence of fighting, often during the mating
season. Fight wounds, caused by claw and teeth
trauma to the skin, are an excellent place for
bacteria to grow and abscesses to form. Abscesses
are pockets of infection in the skin or underlying
tissues. They fill with pus, put pressure on the skin
and surrounding tissues, and cause lameness,
severe swelling and localized pain. The cat is usually lethargic and feverish.</p>

       <p class="text-justify"><b>Preventationt of Abscesses: </b>Any infected fight
wound or abscess should be treated by a
veterinarian. The wound is usually opened, drained,
and flushed to allow healing; treatment with an
antibiotic is usually necessary. Wounds may be
prevented by neutering cats to avoid conflicts in the
mating season or during territorial disputes.
